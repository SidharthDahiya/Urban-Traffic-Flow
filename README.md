# Urban-Traffic-Flow
Project Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts traffic patterns in Chandigarh to optimize urban traffic flow. Using historical data, we apply predictive modeling techniques to identify peak traffic times and propose solutions to improve congestion.

Features
Traffic Data Analysis: Visualizes traffic patterns across different city sectors.
Predictive Modeling: Uses Prophet to forecast future traffic volumes.
Optimization Suggestions: Provides actionable insights to enhance traffic management.

Data
The dataset includes hourly vehicle counts for key locations in Chandigarh:
Sector 17
Industrial Area
Suburb

Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathered synthetic traffic data.
Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized traffic patterns using line plots.
Identified peak hours and potential bottlenecks.
Predictive Modeling:
Applied Prophet for time series forecasting.
Generated forecasts with confidence intervals.
Optimization Suggestions:
Adjusted traffic signals based on peak times.
Proposed alternative routes and public transport enhancements.
